# CPHP - Compiler of PHP written on rust lang.

Fun project for to know better rust lang, VM, asm and make another one compiler for PHP.

It will be the following points:

1. Virtual Machine (VM) that executes our bin code obtained from our assembler(asm) code.
2. Our asm compiler that compiling asm source into bin code for our VM.
3. Compiler that builds asm sources from AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
4. Parser that builds AST from tokens.
5. Lexer that splits PHP source code into tokens for Parser.
